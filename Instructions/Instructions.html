        <h1 id="abt">About to.Do</h1>
        <p id="abtt">to.Do is a simple-to-use online reminder/list application. This webiste was made by some kid for his final project
            but guess where thats gonna get him lmao. Hell, he'll even be surprised if this site works at all despite his crunch hours
            inbetween semestral assessments, AS level preparations and a buncha other stuff. He doesn't even really know why he bothers.
            It's almost as if he thinks this is gonna help with his portfolio or resume or whatever. What a bloke.
        </p>
        <h1 id="htu">How to use to.Do</h1>
        <p id="htut">to.Do was designed with simplicity in mind, in hopes even that even a blind person without arms could use it. to.Do integrates
            state of the art motion tracking, quantum architectural neuronic infrastructure artificial intelligence (Backed by world leaders
            such as the USSR, North Korea, Donald Trump and Dr. Gregg), translucent low opacictated touch screen, a built in megaprocessor
            and yadong integrated graphics. If you understand what any of that meant you're full of bs.
        </p>
        <h1 id="whytodo">Why choose to.Do?</h1>
        <p id="whytodot">Well bud, I really have no control over you, so do whatever you want. But I'll have you know that this project is being endorsed
            by tech giants such as NASA, The Pentagon, Walmart, Blockbuster, Budi Setiawan and Ricardo Milos, so I really suggest you rethink
            whatever thoughts you had about choosing any other software over the obviously overqualified, overpowered and overdesigned to.Do.
        </p>
        <h1 id="whattodo">What can to.Do do that other list apps can't?</h1>
        <p id="whattodot">First of all, thanks to our advanced integrated motion controls, to.Do will be able to control how you move. Feeling tired after a
            long day of work and feel like you're about to drop? No worries! Simply open to.Do, scream your command into the VGA port of your
            device at the top of your lungs and to.Do will do the rest! Thanks to the quantum architectural neuronic infrastructure artificial
            intelligence (Built into to.Do by the way), the site will be able to give you relationship advice! What purpose does the translucent
            low opacitated touch screen serve you may ask? Rub both hands all over you device's screen (Best when used while holding your device
            at least 1.3m above ground) and let the magic happen! You've never heard of yadong integrated graphics? Give it a quick google! Just
            make extra sure that your VPN is on and your parents aren't behind you!
